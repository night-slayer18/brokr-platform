# Commercial License Information

**Brokr Platform** is dual-licensed. This means that in addition to the open-source **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**, we offer a **Commercial License** for enterprises and organizations that require different terms.

## Why Buy a Commercial License?

You should consider purchasing a commercial license if:

*   **You want to use Brokr Platform in a proprietary software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering** without releasing your own source code (which is required by AGPLv3).
*   **You need to make modifications** to the platform and keep them private.
*   **You require a warranty and dedicated support**, which are not provided under the open-source license.
*   **You want to be free from the copyleft restrictions** of the AGPLv3.

## Commercial License Benefits

*   **Proprietary Use**: Use the software in your closed-source applications.
*   **No Copyleft**: No obligation to share your source code.
*   **Legal Assurance**: Indemnification and legal protection.
*   **Priority Support**: Direct access to the development team for support and feature requests.
