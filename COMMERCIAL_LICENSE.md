# Commercial License Information

**Brokr Platform** is dual-licensed. This means that in addition to the open-source
**GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**, we offer a **Commercial License**
for enterprises and organizations that require different terms.

## Why Buy a Commercial License?

You should consider purchasing a commercial license if:

- **You want to use Brokr Platform in a proprietary software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering**
  without releasing your own source code (which is required by AGPLv3).
- **You need to make modifications** to the platform and keep them private.
- **You require support or assistance** that is not provided under the open-source license.
- **You want to be free from the copyleft restrictions** of the AGPLv3.

## Commercial License Benefits

- **Proprietary Use**: Use the software in your closed-source applications.
- **No Copyleft**: No obligation to share your source code.
- **Custom Terms**: Ability to negotiate terms appropriate for your organization.
- **Priority Support**: Option for direct access to the maintainer for support and feature requests.

> Note: The exact terms (including any legal assurances) will be defined in an individual
> commercial license agreement between you and the project owner.
